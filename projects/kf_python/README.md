# 1D and 2D Kalman Filter using Python

The file KalmanFilter.py contains two classes: KalmanFilter1D for 1-Dimensional Kalman filter and KalmanFilter2D for two dimensional Kalman Filter. Run the file test_kf.py to test the Kalman Filters. 

For testing purposes, random noise is added to the data. However, in reality the noise is gaussian in nature.
